\usage{
DianaParamSelection(
  dataset = NULL,
  distance = NULL,
  k = c(2, 5, 10),
  metric = "euclidean",
  nthreads = 4,
  scale = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{A transcriptomics dataset. Preferably filtered first. First
columns should be gene names. All other columns should be expression levels.}

\item{distance}{A distance matrix. If a distance matrix has already been
created (such as by using the DistanceGen function), the matrix can be
passed to this function to save time. If a distance matrix is not provided
then it will be generated by the function.}

\item{k}{A numeric vector giving the number of clusters to be evaluated.}

\item{metric}{The distance metric to be used to calculate the distances
between genes. See parallelDist::parDist for all accepted arguments. Also
allows the option of 'abs.correlation'. Not used if a distance matrix is
provided.}

\item{nthreads}{The number of threads to be used for parallel computations.If
NULL then the maximum number of threads available will be used.}

\item{scale}{Logical. If TRUE then each gene will be scaled}
}
\description{
Runs DIANA (DIvisive ANAlysis) clustering with differing numbers
 of partitions and returns validation metrics.

\examples{
k.options <- seq(2,10)
diana.validation <- DianaParamSelection(Laurasmappings, k=k.options,
                                         nthreads = 2)
}
