\title{TFilter:}
\usage{
TFilter(dataset, maxdifference = 1, minchanges = 2,
  psignificance = 0.05, nthreads = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{A transcriptomics dataset. First columns should be gene names. All other columns should be expression levels.}

\item{maxdifference}{The maximum difference between the number of signifcant positive t statistic and the number of signifcant negative t statistic.}

\item{minchanges}{The minimum number of significant changes found via t-tests for the gene to be included in the filtered dataset.}

\item{psignificance}{The maximum p-value for which a result of a t-test is classed as significant}

\item{nthreads}{Number of processor threads to be used for calculating the distance matrix. If not specifed then the maximum number of logical cores are used.}
}
\value{
Returns a filtered transcriptomics dataset
}
\description{
Experimental! Applies a filter where a t.test is carried out on gene activity levels between time points. The number of significant changes between time points is found. If there is a sufficient number of significant changes and close to as many positive changes as negative changes then the gene is included in the filtered dataset

filterdf <- TFilter(Laurasmappings)
