\title{AgglomClustering:}
\usage{
AgglomClustering(dataset, distance = NULL, k = 10,
  metric = "euclidean", nthreads = NULL, scale = FALSE,
  center = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{A transcriptomics dataset. First columns should be gene names.
All other columns should be expression levels. Not needed if an argument to
distance is given.}

\item{distance}{A distance matrix. If a distance matrix has already been
created (such as by using the \code{\link{DistanceGen}} function), the matrix
can be passed
 to this function to save time. If a distance matrix is not provided then it
 will be generated by the function.}

\item{k}{The total number of clusters.}

\item{metric}{The distance metric to be used to calculate the distances
between genes. See parallelDist::parDist for all accepted arguments.}

\item{nthreads}{Number of processor threads to be used for calculating the
distance matrix. If not specified then the maximum number of logical cores
is used.}

\item{scale}{If the gene activity should be scaled before clustering.}

\item{center}{If the gene activity should be centered before clustering.}
}
\value{
Returns transcriptomics dataset provided with additional cluster
column appended denoted which cluster each gene belongs to.
}
\description{
Applies agglomerative hierarchical clustering to a
 transcriptomics dataset and appends a cluster column to this dataset for all
 genes.

\examples{
pam.df <- AgglomClustering(Laurasmappings, k = 75)
