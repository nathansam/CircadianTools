\title{HClustering:}
\usage{
HClustering(dataset, distance = NULL, k = 10, metric = "euclidean",
  nthreads = NULL, scale = FALSE, center = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{A transcriptomics dataset. First columns should be gene names. All other columns should be expression levels.}

\item{distance}{A distance matrix. If a distance matrix has already been created (such as by using the DistanceGen function), the matrix can be passed to this function to save time. If a distance matrix is not provided then it will be generated by the function.}

\item{k}{The total number of clusters.}

\item{metric}{The distance metric to be used to calculate the distances between genes. See parallelDist::parDist for all accepted arguments.}

\item{nthreads}{Number of processor threads to be used for calculating the distance matrix. If not specifed then the maximum number of logical cores are used.}

\item{scale}{If the gene activity should be scaled before clustering.}

\item{center}{If the gene activity should be centered before clustering.}
}
\value{
Returns transcriptomics dataset provided with additional cluster column appended denoted which cluster each gene belongs to.
}
\description{
Applies Hierarchical clustering to a transcriptomics dataset and appends a cluster column to this dataset for all genes. Not needed if an argument to distance is given.
}
\examples{
pam.df <- Hclustering(Laurasmappings, k = 75)
