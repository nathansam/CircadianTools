\usage{
Jaccard(labels1, labels2)
}
\arguments{
\item{labels1}{a vector of \code{n} clustering labels}

}
\value{
the Jaccard coefficient for the two sets of cluster labels (See
Details.)

\description{
Stolen from the clusteval package as there is currently a bug with the package
on CRAN where this function is not exported from the namespae of clusteval.
Computes the Jaccard similarity coefficient of two clusterings of the same
data set under the assumption that the two clusterings are independent.

For two clusterings of the same data set, this function calculates the Jaccard
similarity coefficient of the clusterings from the comemberships of the
observations. Basically, the comembership is defined as the pairs of
observations that are clustered together.
}
\details{
The Jaccard similarity coefficient is defined as:
\deqn{J = \frac{n_{11}}{n_{11} + n_{10} + n_{01}}}.

In the special case that the Jaccard coefficient results in \eqn{0/0},
we define \eqn{J = 0}. For instance, this case can occur when both clusterings
consist of all singleton clusters.

To compute the contingency table, we use the \code{\link{comembership_table}}
function.
